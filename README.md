# ChickenCheep
An old game I created with Pygame

#Original README:
I have no idea why people make README text documents, but sometimes I read them, because I hope they can tell me something useful. 

I wish that people would actually write the file instead of pasting a wall of text to on single line...

Well, here's the README file for Chicken Cheep.

===============================================
This game has some bugs that I haven't fixed.
Here's a list:

1) The game might stop responding when you lose. I yet haven't figured out why, but give it a couple of seconds and it should return you
to the main menu - This should not affect your highscore. 

2) When closing the game while playing you will get a pop-up saying that the program "returned -1". Ignore that. Doesn't matter.

3) The AI might walk backwards... But hey. They walk backwards!

4) That should be about it. Otherwise, please let me know.
